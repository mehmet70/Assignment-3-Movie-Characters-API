## Name
Assignment 3 Movie Characters API

## Description
We create an Entity Framework Code First workflow of a franchise/movie/character database.

Afterwards, we created a Web API using ASP.NET Core to interact with this database.

## Getting started
Clone the repository locally
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/tiemarmepschen/assignment-3-movie-characters-api.git
```
Open in Visual Studio.

Assuming you have SQL Server installed: run migrations using Package Manager console. Remember to change the connection string in appsettings.json
```
update-database
```
This will create a database in LocalDb, used for development and seed some dummy data.

Run IIS Server to view the Swagger documentation and try out the methods.
